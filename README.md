## üö¶ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/irtaza302/DashBoard-Project.git
   cd gas-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```
     PORT=5000
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     ```

4. **Seed the database (optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   - For development:
     ```bash
     npm run dev:full
     ```
   - For production build:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     npm run server
     ```

6. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## üìö Documentation

- **API Endpoints**
  - `/api/auth/login` - User login endpoint
  - `/api/profiles` - CRUD operations for profiles
  - `/health` - Health check endpoint

- **Frontend Routes**
  - `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with analytics
  - `/profile` - Profile management
  - `/about` - About page
  - `/account` - User management (Admin only)

## üß™ Testing

- Run ESLint for code quality checks:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- TypeScript type checking:
  ```bash
  npm run typecheck
  ```

## üì¶ Deployment

- The application is configured for deployment on Vercel. Use the `vercel-build` script for building the project:
  ```bash
  npm run vercel-build
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Backend Server Not Running**: If you encounter a `ECONNREFUSED` error when accessing API endpoints, ensure that both the frontend and backend servers are running. Use the `npm run dev:full` command to start both servers simultaneously.
- **Port Conflicts**: Ensure that port 5000 is not in use by another application. The `preserver` script can help terminate any process using this port.
- **MongoDB Connection**: Verify that your MongoDB instance is running and the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` file is correct.

## üîê Authentication Details

- **Login Process**: Users can log in using their email and password. The login form is validated using Zod, and upon successful authentication, user data is stored in local storage for session persistence.
- **Role-Based Access**: The application supports role-based access control, allowing only admin users to access certain routes, such as user management.
- **Error Handling**: The application provides user-friendly error messages and feedback using toast notifications, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## üìä Data Visualization

- **Interactive Charts**: The dashboard features interactive charts for visualizing profile data, including graduation trends, degree distribution, and profile timelines.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The application supports real-time updates, ensuring that users always have access to the latest data.
